 I am not sure how to do a read me. I wasn't able to find it on the website so I'm just going to go for it and hope I do it right.

What was a challenge:
I had a very hard time for the last two weeks navigate the website. Not because it was hard to understand, but because I
am truly terrible at getting a groove when it comes to online classes.
As of right now my assignment does work together but I hope that I can figure it out.
The other factor that I struggled with was Github, I didn't understand that I had to physically make a repository for myself.
As I said unless I hear it first hand I have almost 0 comprehension skills.

What was fun:
I found it really nice to use my previous knowledge to choose a background color. And to add to that it was a great pink.
Once I also went and talked to you in your office, I learned how to navigate the website and it eased my anxiety.
